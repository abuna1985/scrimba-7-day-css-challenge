# CSS Challenge Day 1 - Improve This Website

## Requirements

The main goal is to style and improve the HTML given to you to look like the picture below:

<p align="center">
  <img width="600" height="300" src="../assets/images/day-01-end.png">
</p>

- You have to center all the text on the page
- Set the font to `Roboto`
- Capitalize all the titles
- Give the main title a font size of 4em and the section titles a size of `3em`
- Give all the sections an overall margin of `10%` of the height of the page.
- The section titles must have a color of `#3278cf`.
- The main title must have a color of `#174885`.

## Description

So this is the initial output from my `index.html`:

<p align="center">
  <img width="600" height="300" src="../assets/images/day-01-start.png">
</p>
